# 4coder-vimmish
A pretty feature complete vim layer for 4coder with some bugs.
But so far as I know, it's the most complete and usable vim layer for 4coder that's... not up to date right now, it's compatible with 4.1.6.
You can use it if you are on 4.1.6, peep the top of 4coder_vimmish.cpp for instructions.
