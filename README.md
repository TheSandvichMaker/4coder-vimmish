# 4coder-vimmish
A pretty feature complete vim layer for 4coder with some bugs.
It's very usable but questionably up to date right now, and no longer maintained.
When using it, please delete or rename your bindings.4coder file as the code has not been updated to use the new bindings system.

# Try this instead:
https://github.com/B-Y-P/4coder_byp

The above project is actively maintained and more up to date, so it is probably better to use.
