# 4coder-vimmish
A pretty feature complete vim layer for 4coder with some bugs.
But so far as I know, it's the most complete and usable vim layer for 4coder that's... questionably up to date right now.
When using it, please delete your bindings.4coder file until the code is updated to properly use the new bindings system.
