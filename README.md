# 4coder-vimmish
A pretty feature complete vim layer for 4coder with some bugs.
It's very usable but questionably up to date right now, and no longer maintained.
When using it, please delete your bindings.4coder file until the code is updated to properly use the new bindings system.

# Try this instead:
https://github.com/B-Y-P/4coder_byp

The above project is actively maintained and more up to date, so it is probably better to use.
